    "1.\tScientific Question and Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the presence of microbiota (SPF vs GF) alter the spatially organized transcriptomic programs in the mouse colon?\n",
    "Specifically, we will study samples from Specific Pathogen-Free (SPF) and Germ-Free (GF) mice using the GSE245274 dataset and employ both unsupervised and supervised modeling techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific relevance: It is established that microbiota-driven changes in the colon are important for understanding host–microbe interactions, tissue architecture, and immune regulation.\n",
    "Dataset:\n",
    "•\tSource: GSE245274 (mouse intestine Visium spatial transcriptomics) .\n",
    "•\tSubset: Colon region, SPF vs GF (≈6 samples, ~10,000 spots total).\n",
    "•\tData content: Count matrices (genes × spots), spot coordinates, histology images.\n",
    "•\tSize: ~2.4 GB for all 46 slides ; colon subset much smaller.\n",
    "•\tLicense/Ethics: Public GEO; animal data, no restrictions .\n",
    "•\tDirect URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE245274\n",
    "•\tPrimary Publication:\n",
    "Mayassi, T., et al. (2024). Spatial organization of microbial ecology in the mouse intestine. Nature, 630, 580–588.\n",
    "DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08216-z\n",
    "This dataset supports both unsupervised analyses (spatial clustering and differential expression) and supervised graph-based classification (predicting SPF vs GF spots).\n",
    "\n",
    "Task\n",
    "•\tUnsupervised clustering: Identify spatial spot clusters within colon tissue.\n",
    "•\tDifferential expression: Find genes enriched in clusters and between conditions (GF vs SPF).\n",
    "•\tSupervised classification usign GNN graphs. \n",
    "2.\tExploration Goals\n",
    "Data composition and quality across slides: How many spots and genes per sample? Are SPF and GF samples balanced?\n",
    "Value ranges and distributions: Total UMI counts, number of detected genes per spot, normalization consistency.\n",
    "Correlations and structure: Do neighboring spots have similar gene expression? Are there global condition effects (SPF vs GF)?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tProposed Model & Evaluation\n",
    "The analysis will proceed in three major steps:\n",
    "\n",
    " Unsupervised clustering – Identify spatial domains using tools such as SpaGCN, Giotto, or Scanpy’s spatial modules.\n",
    " Differential expression (DE) – Identify cluster-specific and condition-specific markers (SPF vs GF) using DESeq2 or edgeR.\n",
    " Graph Neural Network (GNN) – Train a GCN or GraphSAGE model to predict SPF vs GF condition per Visium spot using spatial adjacency and expression profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance of GNNs:  \n",
    "Spatial transcriptomics data are naturally represented as graphs (spots as nodes, spatial proximity as edges). GNNs can model both molecular features and spatial context, learning complex microenvironmental patterns. This approach can reveal subtle microbiota-related spatial signatures not captured by classical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation:  \n",
    "- Unsupervised: cluster silhouette score, spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s I), biological interpretability.  \n",
    "- Supervised (GNN): accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC, validated by leave-one-slide-out cross-validation.  \n",
    "Good performance = >80% classification accuracy with interpretable feature importance (genes or spatial regions).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Accessibility Plan \n",
    "Option B: MCP Wrapping and Documentation\n",
    "The pipeline will be implemented as a suite of MCP (Modular Computational Pipeline) tools integrated with the Gemini CLI. Each step is callable from the command line and publicly accessible via GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP Tools:\n",
    "1. load_data – Download & preprocess GSE245274 data (filtering, normalization).\n",
    "2. cluster_spatial – Perform spatial clustering (Scanpy, SpaGCN).\n",
    "3. diff_expr – Conduct differential expression between clusters or conditions.\n",
    "4. build_graph – Construct spatial graph representation (nodes = spots, edges = neighbors).\n",
    "5. train_gnn – Train GNN model (GCN/GraphSAGE) for SPF vs GF classification.\n",
    "6. evaluate_model – Evaluate and visualize model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Document workflow and usage in README.\n",
    "• Create Dockerfile for reproducibility (if time allows)\n",
    "• Run pipeline end-to-end to generate results.\n",
    "All outputs (.h5ad, .csv, .pt) will be versioned and uploaded to a public GitHub repository with full documentation and example configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Feasibility Check \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is moderate in size (~40K–50K total spots) and can be processed within 2–3 weeks using a GPU-enabled workstation. Each tool executes independently for modular testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Risks and mitigation:\n",
    "- Limited biological replicates: use cross-validation by slide.\n",
    "- High memory requirements: subset genes (e.g., top 2000 variable genes).\n",
    "- GNN convergence issues: early stopping, dropout, and hyperparameter tuning.\n"
